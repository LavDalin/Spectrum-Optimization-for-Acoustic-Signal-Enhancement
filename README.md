# Spectrum Optimization for Acoustic Signal Enhancement

## Overview
An audio processing project aimed at enhancing bird vocalization analysis through advanced spectrogram filtering and denoising techniques.

## Key Features
- Spectrogram parameter optimization
- Median, Gaussian, Wavelet, and Non-Local Means filters
- ROI-targeted filtering for better species differentiation
- 12% precision improvement (0.733) over baseline methods

## Technologies Used
- Python
- NumPy, SciPy
- Librosa, Matplotlib
- Scikit-image, PyWavelets

## Results
Improved bird species classification accuracy by preserving essential acoustic details while reducing noise from spectrograms.
